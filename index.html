    <p class="text_column">Let's get ready to rumble and power up as you see two of your favorite Sayians from Dragon Ball duke it out for the most powerful Sayian, in well, IN EVERY UNIVERSE. They have fought all kinds of worthy Fights from all 12 universe and from all kinds of walks of lives. But here and now at this moment, after a long waited rematch to an undecisive battle, they are ready to see who is the strongest. The low-class warrior raised on Earth or The Prince of All Sayians. before the fight we will let our fighters say a few words to each other and to the crowd. Vegeta, want to start first.</p>
    <p class="text_column">Give me the mic you low leveled wrentch. YOU ALL KNOW why your here. To see your Prince, Here and now after all the fightings i did, to see me beat up a clown name Kakarotto. For those who aren't proud, strong, SAYIANS, to show your "Goku" that there is only one Super Sayian. Me, The prince of all Sayians, the one and only. VEGETA!!!!!! And as far as for you Kakaratto. How does it feel to know that everyone in this world and in everyone in the universe will see me beat you to a low power level pile of dust. To be honest with Kakaratto, it feels like pure bad ass to me.</p>
    <p class="text_column">Always so cocky aren't you Vegeta. Well your right about one thing. That everyone will witness a beating out of this world. but like your ego when you fought android 18 the first time, it will end crying on the floor. just like you Vegeta every time. With all that talk, you would think that you did beat Freiza, Cell, Majin Buu, and many others. Your own son Trunks beateen Zamasu, Gohan beaten Cell, and everyone lost to who? Me. I may be a low-class warrior, but that doesn't matter right now. I want to finish what we started when we first met. This fight and the excitement of it. I won't keep you waiting Vegeta. LET'S GO!!!! </p>
