    <h2 class="hidden">About</h2>
    <p class="text_column"> Vegeta is a slim yet well-built man of a below-average stature. His hair is black (or dark brown, depending on the media) spiky and it firmly stands upwards and has a prominent widow's peak. Like most Saiyans, he possesses defined eyes with a near-consistently stern look to them and his hair is a shade of black. Like other Universe 7 Saiyans, he was born with a prehensile brown-furred tail, until it was permanently (despite him stating it would grow back eventually) cut off by Yajirobe. </p>
    <p class="text_column"> Over the course of the series, Vegeta's physical appearance changes. While originally appearing very short and lean, especially compared to his massive partner, Nappa, he later seems to be somewhat taller and noticeably more muscular. His hair and forehead appears to be shorter and his facial features, which are perpetually in a scowl, also look more distinct and sharply defined as the series progresses, making him look much older in later sagas compared to what he looked like in the Raditz Saga.  </p>
    <p class="text_column"> A major characteristic of Vegeta's is the fact that he is the only living Saiyan who has continued to don a traditional Saiyan armor. His general look is a dark blue, full-bodied jumpsuit with white gloves and boots with the said armor on top. He has also been seen wearing alternate forms of the armor, customizing the armor to better suit his persona. When first arriving on Earth, he wore a white armor with yellow shoulder pads and also padding at his hips and nether-region. Along with it, he wore a red-lens scouter on his left eye. During the Frieza Saga, he replaced his heavily damaged armor with a similar one, minus the padding around his waistline. He also briefly wore another scouter until deeming it unnecessary. When his armor was damaged against Recoome, he replaced his outfit wit an older model design consisting of a black bodysuit, white gloves and boots, and a near-purely white armor without shoulder pads. In the Trunks saga, he wore a pink short sleeved loose button shirt with the sign "Bad Man" at the back, a white sleeveless undershirt, yellow pants and green shoes with a brown trim. This outfit would later become his casual outfit in Dragon Ball Super when he is not fighting and the outfit has a minor change. His button shirt is dark blue and no longer has a design on its back, his pants were gray and his shoes were brown. During the Androids Saga, he wore an updated version of his original armor, but without pads. During the Buu Saga, to be allowed to fight Goku in the World Martial Arts Tournament, Vegeta fought without armor and his bodysuit had no sleeves. He later wore this outfit during his sparring match against Goku in Dragon Ball Super: Broly as the color of his bodysuit is blue gray/navy blue. </p>
